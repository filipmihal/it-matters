## It matters

### Intro
The IT industry is improving at a rapid pace. Every year new, revolutionary and powerful devices are introduced to the public. However, the way we interact with these devices has not changed in ages. We spend countless hours looking at our computer screens, seriously hurting our eyes. We don't take breaks. Most of us work from cafes where we sit in an unnatural position for an extremely long time. We claim to take care of our health but neglect the impact of the activity that we do the most. 

### About the project
My vision is getting worse and worse, my eyes often feel tired after a long working day and on top of all that my back hurts. I can't imagine my life without a computer yet every additional hour of usage harms my body. Hence, I decided to create a piece of software that would monitor my daily computer interaction. By using it, I would have a clear view on my progress of getting rid of my unhealthy habits. The app's purpose is to be a quiet informer not a loud policeman, so I won't be disturbed while working.
